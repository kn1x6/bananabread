<h1>Nickey Jorgensen</h1>
<h2>Studying astrology, arranging, rearranging</h2>
<p>I have been meaning to create a web page that I can share with people to make it easier to get in touch with me about Astrology readings. I am currently a student, and readings are donation/sliding-scale based for now while I study.</p>
