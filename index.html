    Welcome to my name dot com on the world wide web. I am a student of astrology, and finally have made a landing page for you to visit me and find a link to my calendar. If you're here for a reading, that is very exciting! I wish I could bottle the feeling I get when I have the opportunity to sit with another person and explore their chart with them. Readings are donation/sliding-scale based, no one is turned away for lack of funds. Your contribution helps me pay for the three year course I am enrolled in. Thanks for being here.

  <p>I am fond of the color blue, the ocean, the sky, your eyes</p>
